# **My Experience Building a Basic Calculator for the OIB-SIP Web Development Internship**

During the OIB-SIP Web Development & Design Internship, I completed the Level 2 task: **Building a Basic Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This was my first hands-on assignment in the program, and it helped me understand how real web components work together to form a functional application.

## **Why I Chose This Task**

The calculator looked simple, but I knew it would push me to apply the core fundamentals of web development—structure, styling, and logic. It was the perfect starting point to get comfortable with frontend basics.

## **What I Built**

I created a **fully functional basic calculator** that supports:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Clear/reset functionality

The project used:

* **HTML** for layout
* **CSS** for styling and responsive design
* **JavaScript** for button handling and calculation logic

## **What I Learned**

This task gave me practical exposure to:

* Designing UI layouts using **flexbox**
* Handling button clicks using **event listeners**
* Updating the display dynamically using JavaScript
* Managing calculator logic in a clean and structured way
* Debugging simple DOM and logic issues

Even though it's a beginner-level task, it helped me understand how user interactions flow through a web application.

## **Challenges I Faced**

I ran into a few common issues:

1. **Chaining inputs** – ensuring numbers appeared continuously instead of resetting after each click.
2. **Division edge cases** – handling division by zero gracefully.
3. **Display overflow** – preventing long numbers from breaking the layout.

Fixing these helped me practice debugging and think more carefully about input handling.

## **Overall Internship Experience**

The OIB-SIP internship provided a clear, structured way to practice real web development skills. The tasks were straightforward but still pushed me to think like a developer. Completing this calculator project increased my confidence in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I would definitely recommend this internship to beginners who want practical experience instead of only theory.
